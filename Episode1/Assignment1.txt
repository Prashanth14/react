1. **What is Emmet?**
   Emmet is a plugin used by many code editors that helps in writing HTML and CSS more efficiently. It uses a shorthand syntax that, when expanded, generates the corresponding full HTML or CSS code. This tool significantly speeds up web development by reducing the amount of typing required.

2. **Difference between a Library and a Framework?**
   - **Library:** A library is a collection of functions and procedures that you can call to perform specific tasks. It doesn't impose a structure or dictate the flow of your application. You decide when and where to use the library.
   - **Framework:** A framework, on the other hand, provides a foundation and a set of guidelines or rules that dictate the structure of your application. You fit your code into this structure. In frameworks, the control flow is inverted: the framework calls your code, rather than your code calling into the framework.

3. **What is CDN? Why do we use it?**
   A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers distributed globally to deliver internet content more efficiently to users. The primary purpose of using a CDN is to reduce latency by caching content in multiple locations around the world, so it's closer to end-users. This enhances the speed and performance of web applications, especially for static resources like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

4. **Why is React known as React?**
   React is named for its reactive nature. It's designed to efficiently react to data changes and update the UI accordingly. When the state of a component in React changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state, making the development of interactive user interfaces easier and more intuitive.

5. **What is crossorigin in the script tag?**
   The `crossorigin` attribute in a script tag is used when loading scripts from a different domain than the one serving the web page. This attribute is essential for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. It controls whether and how the browser sends credentials with the request. It's also crucial for error reporting when using external scripts.

6. **Difference between React and ReactDOM?**
   - **React:** The core library that deals with creating components and managing the virtual DOM.
   - **ReactDOM:** A complementary library that specifically deals with DOM-related rendering and interactions in web browsers. It's responsible for updating the browser's DOM to match the React components.

7. **Difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?**
   - **react.development.js:** This file is a development version of React. It includes extra warnings, error messages, and is not optimized for performance. It's useful during development for debugging and providing meaningful feedback.
   - **react.production.js:** This is the production version of React. It's optimized for performance with minified code and without the additional development warnings and messages. This version should be used in production environments.

8. **What is async and defer?**
   Both `async` and `defer` are attributes used in `<script>` tags for controlling the behavior of external JavaScript files.
   - **Async:** The `async` attribute tells the browser to continue parsing the HTML page while the script is being downloaded, and execute it as soon as it's downloaded. This doesn't guarantee the order in which scripts are executed.
   - **Defer:** The `defer` attribute also allows the browser to continue parsing while the script is downloaded, but it defers the execution of the script until after the HTML parsing is complete. This maintains the order of scripts as they appear in the document.
